# Window Hotkey

this is so far a proof of concept

this is supposed to work like a hotkey for switching between app windows on your windows pc (like a replacement for alt+tab)

---
it relies on the win32 api so no linux or mac version

- on linux there are way to many window managers to care for this 

- and mac is just some overpriced aliuminum (joke ðŸ’€)
